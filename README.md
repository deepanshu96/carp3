**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

My project includes the following files:
* [model.py](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/model.py) containing the script to create and train the model.
* [model.ipynb](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/model.ipynb) the jupyter notebook of the model which I used.
* [drive.py](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/drive.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode.
* [model.h5](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/model.h5) containing a trained convolution neural network. 
* [writeup_report.md](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/writeup_template.md) summarizing the results.
* [run1.mp4](https://github.com/deepanshu96/carp3/blob/master/run1.mp4) is the video generated by the car in autonomous mode.
* The screen recording of car, driving on track one is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKrsjrtR-i8).
